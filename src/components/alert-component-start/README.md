# Step 1 - Creating a basic component

Import Component from Stencil and create basic component with two buttons and a div to display the current value.

## Run the test

Your choice but I'd recommend you try to write tests

```bash
npm t
```

## See it running

Change src/index.html to render the component

```html
<alert-component-start></alert-component-start>
```
